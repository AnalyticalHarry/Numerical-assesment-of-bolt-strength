# Open Research 

Welcome to the repository for **"Bolted Joint Analysis,"** an open research project focused on the numerical assessment of bolt strength. This project explores various aspects of bolt mechanics using free and open-source tools, including Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Python libraries. It aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of bolt strength, encompassing mechanical forces, tensile strength, and shear strength in different conditions.

## Sections
### Mechanical Bolt Forces

- **Overview**: This section explains the different forces acting on a bolt when tightened, including clamping, preloading, shear, and tension forces.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Explore how these forces contribute to the overall strength and stability of bolted joints.

### Tensile Strength of Bolt

- **Python Code**: Provides calculations for tensile stress, area, and factor of safety based on user input for force, bolt diameter, and material properties.
- **Example Output**: Shows calculations for a bolt under a tensile load of 17,000 N with a diameter of 8 mm.

### Single Shear Strength of Bolt

- **Analysis**: Examines the single shear force where the load is applied on one plane.
- **Code and Calculations**: Includes code and examples for determining shear stress and factor of safety in single shear conditions.

### Double Shear Strength of Bolt

- **Analysis**: Investigates the double shear force where the load is distributed across two planes.
- **Code and Calculations**: Provides code and example calculations for double shear stress and factor of safety under given conditions.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python Libraries**: Math, Statistics, Pandas, IPython Widgets.
- **Software**: Jupyter Notebooks for executing and visualizing calculations.
